### **About Me**
   I am David Kohav, a visionary AI Architect and Backend Engineering Leader with over 15 years of experience designing and deploying high-performance AI systems. Specializing in Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and scalable microservices architectures, I excel in leading cross-functional teams, developing AI-powered CRM solutions, and optimizing AI workflows for real-time data processing and actionable insights.

As an expert in LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, and AI-driven solutions across financial, HR, and customer engagement sectors, I have consistently demonstrated success in driving AI automation, enhancing customer experiences, and significantly increasing operational efficiency. My core expertise includes advanced Generative AI & NLP technologies (such as GPT-4, Llama 2, Mistral, Claude, BERT, and PaLM 2), RAG systems, vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, Faiss), and sophisticated backend engineering leveraging Python, FastAPI, Django, and modern cloud infrastructures like Kubernetes, Docker, and Terraform.

Currently leading innovative AI projects at MLDK-Tech, I have architected and deployed AI-driven automation solutions, resulting in an impressive reduction in response times, increased customer engagement, and substantial operational cost savings. Notable projects include the Banker AI Assistant, designed to streamline financial interactions, and Marketing-Intelligent, an advanced system for secure, efficient company relationship management.

Dedicated to mentoring and thought leadership, I frequently share my insights at industry conferences and guide emerging engineers in cutting-edge AI and data science practices. My mission is to drive the next wave of GenAI innovation, optimizing business operations, enhancing customer engagement, and pioneering intelligent automation for sustainable growth.
